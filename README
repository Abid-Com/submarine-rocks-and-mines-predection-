# üëç PROJECTS TITLES: SUBMARINE ROCK AND MINES PREDECTION USING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS..


# ABSTRACT:  Underwater Mine usage by the naval defense system provides great security but also possesses a threat to the marine life and submarine vessels as the 
mines can be easily mistaken for rocks. We need a much more accurate system to predict the object as it is very dangerous if a mistake is made. To have a great 
accuracy we need accurate data to generate accurate results. 
This paper presents a method for the prediction of underwater mines and rocks using Sonar signals. Sonar signals are used to record the various frequencies of 
underwater objects at 60 different angles. We constructed three binary classifier models according to their accuracy. Then, prediction models are used to predict the
mine and rock categories. Python and Supervised Machine Learning Classification algorithms are used to construct these prediction models

# INTRODUCTION:  
    UNDERWATER MINES:  Underwater mines or naval mines are self-contained explosive devices placed in water to destroy enemies surface ships or submarines. mines were
    only activated by physical contact but the newly created mines can be activated by various methods.Modern mines can be activated by acoustic, pressure, and, 
    magnetic changes in the water which provoke them to explode. These are called influence mines . Generally, underwater mines are classified as offensive or 
    defensive warfare. Mines are strewn across hostile shipping lanes in order to damage merchant ships and military boats. Defensive mines are placed along 
    coastlines to divert enemy submarines and ships away from critical locations and into more heavily guarded places.
    
    
 # SONAR: Sound Navigation and Ranging system works on sound waves to steer and detect objects. In general, SONAR is used for acoustic mine detection that comes under 
         Military purposes. It is also used for Finding Fish, Mapping the Sea bottom, and also for locating sea divers which are Non Military purposes. The sound wave 
         attenuation, which increases rapidly with frequency and limits the reachable distance, restricts the frequency used for a specific underwater sonar 
         application (or range).In mine hunting, the frequencies of underwater SONARs vary between 0.1 and 1 MHz (and their range between 1 and 0.1 km, respectively). 
         Sonar prefers ultrasonic waves instead of infrasonic, as they cannot move under the water, and even though they have long wavelengths they cannot capture much
         energy. We have active and passive SONAR. Passive SONAR is only used to detect noisesso they are named Listening SONAR.
